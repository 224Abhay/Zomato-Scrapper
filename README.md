## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### User-Agent and Headers
The scraper uses custom headers to mimic a browser. You can modify these in the `zomato` class:

```python
self.headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36...",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
}
```

### Geolocation Services
The scraper uses `ipify.org` and `ipinfo.io` for location detection. You can replace these with alternative services in `location.py`.
